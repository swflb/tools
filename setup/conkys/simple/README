Also, I use Linux Mint. Which is Debian based like Ubuntu so this Conky Script is O.K for both

#CTRL-H to see hidden files or 'ls -a' in terminal to see them

# First, if you haven't already done so install conky
#     'sudo apt-get install conky'

#Now install all the fonts this conky script uses
#They are in the conkyfonts folder

# To monitor your HDD and CPU you'll need to run
#     'sudo apt-get install hddtemp'
#     'sudo apt-get install lm-sensors'       ...without the quotations obviously 

# Also, if you dont have python you will need a parser
#      'sudo apt-get install python-feedparser'
# but honestly, just install python, it is fantastic

# Now, this file ('.conkyrc') goes in your home directory. Its hidden so CTRL-H to see it. The (.) in .conkyrc hides it
# So it's path should look like this '~/.conkyrc'
# Then, the whole folder '.conky_scripts' also goes in the home folder
# It's path should be '~/.conky_scripts'  as you can see it is also hidden. No ugly clutter.
# Now, go into startup menu and add the conky.sh to the applications. This will start it up when you login.
# There is a sleep command in it so that it initializes after your desktop. So it shows up.
# Adjust this depending on how fast your computer starts up

# Because every one has different screen sizes and resolution you will have to play around
# with the positioning and everything. Hopefully this info is easy to understand

# Also, the python scripts weathericon.py and thermostaticon.py are really just a hack job, I didn't bother to 
# scope out all the different sorts of cloud cover so you may have to add in some types
# also also, it features cloud cover not weather... which is odd. Will have to fix that in the future

# Some useful commands
# 'conky &' runs conky, which runs '~/.conkyrc' each time you run it instances will appear (they stack on top of eachother)
# 'conky -c conkyrcsomething' runs a specific conky script, useful for multiple conky instances
# 'killall conky' does as it indicates, it stops all instances of conky
