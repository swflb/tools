Keep away from eyes that bleed.

Don’t lick vomit off the street.

And I know you don’t want to die,

    So slowly back away from that infected guy.

    Staying Ebola free. Staying Ebola free

    Don’t eat that raw meat and see,

    We’ll be Ebola free.

    Keep away from those sweaty sheets,

    Keep away from this charge that secretes.

    And if you want to calm your fear,

    Put down that glass of diarrhoea.

    Staying Ebola-free. Staying Ebola-free

    Don’t touch other’s poop and pee

    Be Ebola-free

    Just wash your hands, and you will see,

    We can be Ebola-free.
